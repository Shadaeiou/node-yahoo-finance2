Indeed, for the past decade, the performance record has favored growth. Since 2010, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed more than 550%, compared to an advance of almost 300% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In eight of the past 10 years, growth stocks have topped value stocks. That hasn't always been the case. In the 2000-2010 decade, which included two Bear Markets and the Great Recession, value stocks were better performers than growth stocks, advancing an admittedly low 8% -- but still better than growth, which declined 15% during the decade. Value investors trace their roots to the famous \\\"Security Analysis\\\" textbook, written in 1934 (the year Argus Research was founded) by Ben Graham, an economics professor at Columbia University. Warren Buffett was one of his students. Looking ahead, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has given a lift to some of the cyclical companies (Energy sector companies in particular) that have lagged in recent years, and value stocks outpaced growth stocks in the past year. Now, the Federal Reserve is lifting interest rates to fend off inflation, which likely will cap multiple expansion for growth companies. In any event, value is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 2.0%, compared to the 0.7% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. For our list this week, we screened our coverage universe for stocks that are BUY-rated by Argus Research analysts, have an Argus Financial Strength rating of at least Medium, and have a yield of 3.0% or higher.  Here's a baker's dozen of stocks that meet the criteria.\",\"reportType\":\"Stock Picks\",\"tickers\":[\"C\",\"BCE\",\"F\",\"IP\",\"SPG\",\"DOW\",\"PRU\",\"PSX\",\"IBM\",\"EIX\",\"ENB\",\"GILD\",\"PM\"]}],\"sigDevs\":[{\"headline\":\"Mobetize Corp appoints Grant Thornton LLP as auditors\",\"date\":\"2015-05-06\"}]},\"error\":null}}"
